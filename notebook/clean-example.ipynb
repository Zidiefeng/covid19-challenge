    "In this notebook, I quickly explore the `biorxiv` subset of the papers. Since it is stored in JSON format, the structure is likely too complex to directly perform analysis. Thus, I not only explore the structure of those files, but I also provide the following helper functions for you to easily format inner dictionaries from each file:\n",
    "* `format_name(author)`\n",
    "* `format_affiliation(affiliation)`\n",

    "Feel free to reuse those functions for your own purpose! If you do, please leave a link to this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the EDA, I show you how to use each of those files. At the end, I show you how to generate a clean version of the `biorxiv` as well as all the other datasets, which you can directly use by choosing this notebook as a data source (\"File\" -> \"Add or upload data\" -> \"Kernel Output File\" tab -> search the name of this notebook).\n",

Soon after identification of the first infections, both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases were transported to designated medical facilities specialized in infectious diseases in Japan. However, these patients were treated as external (imported) cases, and a detailed description of their clinical progression is not publicly available.The asymptom\n"
